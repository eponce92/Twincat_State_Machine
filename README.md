# Twincat State Machine

A collection of TwinCAT 3 automation projects focused on industrial process control and sequential operations.

## Repository Structure

### Personal-Libraries
Contains custom TwinCAT libraries for industrial automation:

- **State Machine Library**: A comprehensive framework for managing sequential automation processes
  - State management with multiple operational states (Running, Stopping, Homing, etc.)
  - Step-by-step sequence control with timeout and fault handling
  - Permissive systems for safety interlocks and bypass functionality
  - HMI integration structures for operator interfaces

### Training HMI
Practical implementation examples showing how to use the custom libraries:

- **PLC Project**: Demonstrates real-world usage of the state machine library
  - Main program orchestrating state machine operations
  - Sequence programs for different operational states
  - Integration of library function blocks in working applications

## Purpose

This repository serves as both a development workspace and reference implementation for:

- **Library Development**: Creating reusable automation components
- **Training Materials**: Showing practical implementation patterns
- **Project Templates**: Providing starting points for new automation projects

## Technology Stack

- **TwinCAT 3**: Beckhoff automation software platform
- **Structured Text (ST)**: Primary programming language
- **Function Block Programming**: Modular, reusable automation components

## Development Status

Both the library and implementation projects are actively under development. The focus is on creating robust, reusable components for industrial automation while maintaining flexibility for various application requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Explore the **Personal-Libraries** folder to understand available automation components
2. Review the **Training HMI** project to see practical implementation examples
3. Refer to individual project documentation for specific implementation details
